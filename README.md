# gowv
golang webview wrapper for golang. webview_go exists but doesn't contain some features i want, also why no error checking?. therefore, i decided to have a shot at fixing that. definitely should not use in production. this is just for fun. 

# TODO
- [ ] linux, windows and macos compat
- [ ] all API functions supported
