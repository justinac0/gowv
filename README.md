# gowv
**gowv** is a webview wrapper for go, it's heavily based of `webview/webview_go`.
It provides extra control over underlying the native window which I was looking
for in webview.

## Setup
- Read the official webview `README.md`: https://github.com/webview/webview/tree/master
  - Particularly `Prerequisites` and Getting started.
### 
### Windows
- download installer https://www.msys2.org/
- run `pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc`
- set env path to bin/ of urct64
## TODO
- [ ] darwin support with extension functions
